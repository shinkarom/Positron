-- desc:   WASM Introduction
-- script: wasm

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
WASM is a binary format. The demo 
binary code is embedded in this 
cartridge, the source code is not.
Run the cart to see the demo.

This demo exits for completeness, but
you can't (yet) develop WASM projects
using the built-in editor.

The code used to build this project 
can be found in the TIC-80 repo:

https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80
/demos/wasm/

This demo was built with Zig, but many 
languages are supported. You simply 
build your project with your external
compiler, then import the final WASM
binary into your cartridge:
 
  import binary out.wasm

To learn more visit our Wiki and
the 'Getting Started with WASM' page.
